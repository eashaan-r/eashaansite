## How I plan to complete the notes for the MC:
# Go through questions 
# Find what I don't understand 
# Google, research, and problem solve
# Take Notes
# Watch college board video
# reflect and try again


The Internet:

Internet Basics: This includes understanding the structure of the internet, the role of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and the functioning of servers and clients.
Internet Protocols: This involves learning about various internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and TCP/IP and understanding how they facilitate communication and data transfer.
World Wide Web (WWW): This covers the basics of the World Wide Web, including web development, HTML, CSS, and the concept of web browsers.
Programming:

Variables and Data Types: This involves understanding different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and boolean values, and how to store and manipulate them using variables.
Loops and Conditionals: This includes learning about loops (e.g., for loops, while loops) and conditional statements (e.g., if-else statements) to control the flow of program execution.
Functions and Algorithms: This covers the use of functions to organize code and the development of basic algorithms for solving specific problems.
Data Analysis:

Data Representation: This includes understanding how data is represented in various formats, such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, and the use of data structures like arrays and lists.
Data Processing: This involves learning how to process and manipulate data, including sorting, filtering, and searching.
Data Visualization and Analysis: This covers techniques for visualizing data through graphs, charts, and other visual representations, as well as basic statistical analysis methods.
Algorithms:

Algorithm Design: This involves learning about different algorithm design techniques, such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
