Question 5
Option C:

A = false, B = true, C = true, D = true

OR gate with inputs A and B: The OR gate produces a true output if at least one of its inputs is true. In this case, A = false, and B = true, so the output of the OR gate is true.

AND gate with inputs C and D: The AND gate produces a true output only if both of its inputs are true. In this case, C = true, and D = true, so the output of the AND gate is true.

AND gate with inputs from the first two gates: The third gate takes the outputs of the OR and AND gates as inputs. In this case, both inputs are true. Since both inputs to the third gate are true, the output of the third gate is true.

Therefore, with the given input values in option C, the overall output of the circuit is true. This is because the OR gate and both AND gates produce true outputs based on the specified input values.

Question 11
Red: 11111111 in binary is 255 in decimal.
Green: 11111111 in binary is 255 in decimal.
Blue: 11110000 in binary is 240 in decimal.
So, the RGB triplet (11111111, 11111111, 11110000) corresponds to the decimal values (255, 255, 240), which is the RGB triplet for the color "ivory" in the provided table. So the answer is Ivory

Question 23
The algorithm starts with the oval labeled "Start."

It then goes to the conditional step labeled "weekday = true." If this condition is true, it proceeds to the next conditional step.

The next conditional step is "miles are less than 20." If this condition is true, it sets the variable "available" to true. If the condition is false, it sets "available" to false.

If the initial condition "weekday = true" is false, it directly sets "available" to false.

available
=
weekday AND 
(
miles
<
20
)
available=weekday AND (miles<20)

This is represented in the code snippet in option D:

available
←
weekday AND 
(
miles
<
20
)
available←weekday AND (miles<20)

So, option D is the correct equivalent statement that represents the logic in the flowchart.
