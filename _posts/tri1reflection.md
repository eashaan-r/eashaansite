# I learned how to use vscode and manage and use my notebook in it
# I learned how to use github, commit, pull, and share repositories 
# I made a geography game by collaborating with my team. It was a fun experience and a fun game too
# I plan to learn how to be more independent and use my resources to learn and edit my code successfully
